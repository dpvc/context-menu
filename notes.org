Let's keep things simple:

* Events
  Provide one function to register the event(s) with an element.
** Keyboard events
** Mouse events
** Touch events (to implement later)


* Navigatable: Element with key events etc. Has an html element, role, class
** Menu: Abstract class of Menus
*** Context_Menu
*** Sub_Menu
** Entry: Abstract class of Menu Entries
*** Item_Rule: Separator rule item (From entry)
*** Item_Label: Command executing item (From entry)
*** Item: Abstract class of items with mouse events
**** Item_Command: Command executing item
**** Item_Submenu: Submenu item
**** Item_Radio: Radiobutton item
**** Item_Checkbox:  checkbox 

* Menu Structure in HTML
** MenuFrame: Transparent element on the entire page to ensure menu can be closed.
*** Outer div attached to the page.
*** Inner div covering the entire page.
** Menu: Basic element holding one entire context menu.
** MenuItem: Single items in the context menu.

* Some Typescript things:
** Return types can be omitted in method implementation if they are given in the interface specification.
** Getting around the this problem in callbacks:
